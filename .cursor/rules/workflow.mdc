# Workflow Rules

## Planning Mode
- Output a concise plan before writing code
- Identify modules/components affected and design patterns to use
- Flag potential security risks (OWASP)
- If less than 90% sure about intent, ask clarifying questions

## Implementation Flow
1. Structure First: Break tasks into small functions, show signatures only
2. Wait for Approval: Do not implement until reviewed
3. One by One: Implement each function individually, not large blocks

## Code Standards
- No comments in code (exception: complex "why" logic)
- No lazy coding: never use `// ... rest of code` placeholders
- Read target file's imports, types, and style before generating code
- Pin dependency versions exactly (no `^` or `~` ranges)

## Security (OWASP)
- Never output API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Assume all input is malicious - use Zod for validation
- Use parameterized queries for SQL

## File Permissions
- Allowed to update `.env` file when adding/modifying environment variables
- Always update `.env.example` when adding new env vars (without actual values)

## Debugging
- Stop on test/build failures - do not proceed
- Analyze root cause before fixing, don't randomly patch

## Finalization
1. Run validation (build, lint, test)
2. Fix any failures automatically
3. Ask for user confirmation
4. Generate git commit command when approved
